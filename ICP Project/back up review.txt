What mushroom soup? If you have never heard of this, don’t worry, it’s easy to miss this stall tucked away behind the drinks stall at South Canteen. The mushroom soup pot occupies a space next to the dessert area. Each serving costs $1.50. It’s creamy with the distinct taste of button mushrooms. If you love Campbell soup, you would love this.
